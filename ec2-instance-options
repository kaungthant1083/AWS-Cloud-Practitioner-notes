AWS EC2 Instance Purchasing Option
Amazon provides different ways to pay for the EC2 instances
On-Demand Instances
Reserved Instances
Spot Instances
Light, Medium, and Heavy Utilization Reserved Instances are no longer available for purchase and were part of the Previous Generation AWS EC2 purchasing model
AWS also allows you to launch EC2 instance on shared or dedicated tenancy
EC2 Dedicated Instances
Dedicated Instances are EC2 instances that run in a VPC on hardware that’s dedicated to a single customer
Dedicated Instances are physically isolated at the host hardware level from the instances that aren’t Dedicated Instances and from instances that belong to other AWS accounts.
Each VPC has a related instance tenancy attribute, and can’t be changed after the VPC has been created. Default is shared
Each instance launched into a VPC has a tenancy attribute, can’t be changed after the instance is launched. Default tenancy depends on the VPC tenancy.
Dedicated Instances can be launched using
Create the VPC with the instance tenancy set to dedicated, all instances launched into this VPC are Dedicated Instances even though if you mark the tenancy as shared
Create the VPC with the instance tenancy set to default, and specify dedicated tenancy for any instances that should be Dedicated Instances when you launch them.
On-Demand Instances
Pay for the instances and the compute capacity that you use by the hour, with no long-term commitments or up-front payments
Instances can be scaled accordingly as per the demand
Although AWS makes effort to have the capacity to launch On-Demand instances, there might be instances during peak demand where the instance cannot be launched
Well suited for
Users that want the low cost and flexibility of Amazon EC2 without any up-front payment or long-term commitment
Applications with short term, spiky, or unpredictable workloads that cannot be interrupted
Applications being developed or tested on Amazon EC2 for the first time
Reserved Instances
Reserved Instances provides lower hourly running costs by providing a billing discount as well as capacity reservation that is applied to instances and there would never be a case of insufficient capacity from AWS
Discounted usage price is fixed for as long as you own the Reserved Instance, allowing compute costs prediction over the term of the reservation.
Reserved instances are best suited if consistent, heavy, use is expected and they can provide savings over owning your own hardware or running only On-Demand instances.
Well Suited for
Applications with steady state or predictable usage
Applications that require reserved capacity
Users able to make upfront payments to reduce their total computing costs even further

Reserved instance is not a physical instance that is launched, but its just an accounting term applied to the instance usage during billing
Reserved Instances do not renew automatically, and the EC2 instances can be continued to be used but charged On-Demand rates
Auto Scaling or other AWS services can be used to launch the On-Demand instances that use the Reserved Instance benefits
With Reserved Instances
You pay for the entire term, regardless of the usage
Once purchased, the reservation cannot be cancelled but can be sold in the Reserved Instance Marketplace
Reserved Instance pricing tier discounts only apply to purchases made from AWS, and not to the third party Reserved instances
